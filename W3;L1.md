## Grammars 📚 

### Notation ✏️ 

1. RegEx
   1. `^a.*b.+c$` matches any line that starts with an `a` followed by any number of characters, then followed by a `b` followed by any non-empty characters, ending with `c`
      1. Think of this as a **pattern**
      2. Or as a grammar, where:

```
S => 'a' chars 'b' non-empty chars 'c'
char => a
char => b
char => c
chars => [EMPTY]
chars => char chars
```

2. Internet RFC notation
   1. trying to standardize what can go onto the internet
   2. there are thousands of RFCs, each specifying a different protocol (specifying what bytes can be transmitted over the network as packets)
   3. these are not language grammars  but rather *data grammars*
   4. ex: Internet RFC 5322

```
Header:
	Message-ID: <eggert23.$fs."abc"@cs.ucla.edu>
Body:
```

where the grammar for this is composed of:

```
Message-ID: "<" word *("." word) "@" atom *("." atom)">"
```

You can see the similarity to RegEx, but it is technically **EBNF** (extended BNF (Backer-Naus Form))
