## Namespaces and Visibility and Information Hiding, Oh My! 🦁🐯🐻 

*Q: What is the ultimate goal of "information hiding"? To protect valuable data? To combat would-be attackers? To hide the complexity of our programs?*

A: **Flexibility**, we can change the implementation without changing the interface/the callers' code. 

### Java ☕️ 

In Java, there is **both** a class hierarchy 🌳 and a package hierarchy 🌳

- This is because the class hierarchy is about runtime behavior, you use the class hierarchy to specify how the objects behave at runtime (i.e. `GreenString` subclasses from `String`, we are saying something about how the objects behave at runtime)
- The package hierarchy is about who is responsible for the code. If you find a bug in a given package, you can send a bug report to a specific handler.



Java has a few different keywords ("visibility modifiers") that show its approach to information hiding:

1. public
2. protected
3. (default)
4. private

|           | this class | another class<br />(in same package) | a subclass<br />(outside this package) | everywhere else |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| public    | X          | X                                    | X                                      | X               |
| protected | X          | X                                    | X                                      |                 |
| (default) | X          | X                                    |                                        |                 |
| private   | X          |                                      |                                        |                 |

However! There is some controversy amongst language designers who say that this is TOO controlling, too specific and does not allow enough developer controller. Instead, they propose:

### OCaml 🐪 Namespaces

**Module** namespaces

ex:

```ocaml
(*provides definition *)
module q = struct
			type b queue = Empty | Node of int
			let enqueue = ...

(*provides declaration *)
module type Q = sig 
				type b queue
				enqueue: a -> a queue
				end
```



## Interfaces 👮‍♀️ 

Java is **single-inheritance**: one class inherits from at most one class. However, you can get around that with **interfaces** (i.e. `implements`)

- Similar to protocols in Swift
- Interaces are - in a way - **opposite** from inheritance: inheritance "gives you code for free", interfaces make you *write new code* ✏️ 



```java
class C extends P implements I, J, K {
    
}
```

Interfaces can also form a hierarchy 🌳! Just like classes and modules

Note that interfaces are **abstract**: they do not implement the functions they require. YOU must do it!



## Final Classes

Abstract classes are only useful if subclassed, eventually. A logical answer to this is the *final class*: a class that cannot be subclassed.

- You can also have final methods (you cannot override in a subclass)



Yay! 🎉 A new feature! 😁 

... But *why* 🤷‍♂️ 



*Q: What do final classes offer to us? Why do you want to guarantee behavior ONLY in final classes rather than all the time?*

A: In a way, final classes are actually INflexible, contrasting our usual goal in software engineering to maximize customizability. As Eggert says, he once tried to run a software simulator in Java. The module was poorly implemented, written by a biologist 🧬 🐠. All over the module was `final`. Was this just the biologist being a bad coder? Well, the takeaway here is **performance** ⚡️. When you mark a class as `final`, because it cannot be overwritten, all code in the class can be inlined. The Java compiler can merely look at how the code is implemented and splice that directly into the executable/bytecodes.

## Back to Java

### Vanilla Objects 🍦: Why?

In Java, you have the `Object` constructor to create an Object with no properties. Why would you ever use this? For testing purposes mostly: to make sure your code can work on Objects even with nothing "on" them.

### equals

Java has two ways of equality:

- `public boolean equals(Object obj)` for string comparison
- `==` for address/pointer equality



We also have the `public int hashCode()` function, which is needed for efficient manipulation of objects. We generate a hash code and use this to put the Object into a hash table.

- Iff `o1.equals(o2)` then `o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()`



### `toString`

Why? 

**D E B U G G I N G** 🐛 

Similar to `printf` or `console.log`



### `finalize`

`finalize` is a method called on your object by the garbage collector 🗑 just before it is deleted 🔪😱



### Reflection

Your program is looking in a mirror and it is basing its computation on what it sees in the "mirror." Useful for debugging. Eggert said we won't go into it so...



### clone

If `o.clone()` does not throw `CloneNotSupportedException`, then `o` has been cloned.

There are two ways to create a new object in Java:

- `new`
- `clone`

This can get tricky in Java because there is a **clonable interface** that promises on Object can be cloned successfully.



### Thread API 🧵 

Three key methods:

1. `o.wait()`
2. `o.notify()`
3. `o.notifyAll()`
