## Garbage Collection (cont.) 🗑 

### Mark and Sweep 🧹 

### Put all unwanted objects onto free list

### Conservative Collector 🐘 

Put the heap in a "strange" place 🔮 🧬 

For use when you don't know exactly where pointers are

#### ⚠️ Trouble ⚠️ 

When people call `malloc (80)`, the code for the program is in `%rax`

However, `malloc` says to

```assembly
movq %rax, 80(%rsp)
```

## Python Storage Management

Python was actually written in C, so it uses `malloc`/`free` at a low level

**Reference counts** - When the reference count to an object becomes 0, free the storage! 🗑 

- 👎 Can create circular references 
- Newer implementations of Python do the following:
  - If low on memory, fall back on mark and sweep
