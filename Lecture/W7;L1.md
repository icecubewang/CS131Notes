## Prolog Debugging üêú 

```prolog
?- ask(A) :-
	A = 5,
	A = 2+7.

?- ask(A), write(A), nl, fail.
5
2+7
fail
```

Think of a debugger as a *program browser*. It doesn't help you fix or diagnose your problems but rather lets you explore it in its execution.

Debugging in Prolog follows the **4 Port Model** üö¢ 

```
---call---> [GOAL G]	---> succeed
						---> or fail
						---> or backtrack/retry
```

The four "ports" are:

1. call
2. succeed
3. fail
4. backtrace

You can use the keyword `trace` but it will be very verbose, so only use as a beginner

- exit using `notrace`

## Terminology üìñ 

**Fact** - A simple statement in the knowledge base, comprised of atoms.



**Rule** - A conditional statement declared with `conclusion :- premise`



**Query** - The starting point of actual computation. A question for the computer. ü§ñ 



Prolog works with **backwards chaining**, it does NOT deduce from the knowledge base (i.e. forwards chaining)

- starts at the query and then goes through the rules to facts
- goal-oriented üéØ 
  - left-to-right evaluation ‚û°Ô∏è 
  - left-to-right for goals within a query (using AND operations (once you get a single false, stop ‚úã ))
  - left-to-right for heads of clauses in program (using OR operations (once you get a single true, stop ‚úã ))

## Built-In Predicates üß± 

The SECOND simplest is `true`

- always results in `yes`

The simplest is `fail`

- always results in `no`
- simpler than true because it has no source code at all, no evaluation is done

`loop`

- Search through the entire knowledge base
- If no goal is provided, will result in infinite loop ‚ôæ 
  - `loop`
    - `loop`
      - `loop`

```
repeat.
repeat :- repeat.
```

- Since `repeat` resolves, it will NOT result in an infinite loop üõë  ‚ôæ 
- `repeat` is useful for getting input from the user:
  - `?- repeat, read(X), write(X), nl, fail.`

```
crepeate :- crepeate.
crepeate.
```

WON'T WORK! Infinite loop

## Prolog Computation

> Think of a Prolog computation as being a giant AND-OR tree üå≤ 

## Unification ‚òùÔ∏èüåé 

Unification is a combination of assignment and equality used to reconcile a given query with the state of the knowledge base.

```
p(X,X).
% This is a predicate that is true if its two arguments are the same
p(
	f(
		g(A), 
		h(J)
	),
	f(
		X, 
		h(g(Z)))
)
% can we unify X to g(A) AND to X?
% and can we unify X to h(J) AND h(g(Z))?
% yes!
% but if we change h(g(Z)) to i(g(Z)), it will not work!

p(Z, f(Z))
% Z is an unbound variable that points to itself
% f is a structure of arity 1 (1 argument) with a functor of "f"
% the argument that f takes is Z, which points to itself
% the interpreter will bind "X" to Z
% it will then try to bind "X" to f(Z)
% this will work because "X" is an unbound variable
% in doing so, the interpreter will remove Z's "self" pointer
% and replace it with a pointer from f(Z) to Z
% and in doing so, will create an infinite loop
% which can be represented by f(f(f(f(f(...)))))
% this is called an INFINITE TERM
% or a CYCLIC TERM

p(L, [_ | L])
% this will create an infinite list with infinite length
L = [_ | L]
```

**Infinite Terms** are considered a problem with Prolog's unification system

- `unify_with_occurs_check(A, B)` is exactly like `A=B` but it avoids infinite terms
- unify keeps a data structure that checks that A never appears anywhere in B, lest it create a cycle
- efficiency of `unify with occurs check` is O(max(|A|, |B|))
- efficiency of regular unification is O(min(|A|, |B|))
  - because of this efficiency hit, `unify_with_occurs` is rarely used in practice, placing trust of the programmer to simply not create infinite terms
