## Scheme Definitions üîÆ 

### and

```scheme
(define-syntax and
	(syntax-rules ()
		((and) #t)
		((and x) x)
		((and x1 x2 ...)
			(if x1 (and x2 ...) #f)
		)
		; "..." are trailing args
	)
)
```

ex:

```
(and E1 E2)
;becomes
(if E1 (and E2) #f)
;becomes
(if E1 E2 #f)
```

### or

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è WRONG way

```
(define-syntax or
	(syntax-rules ()
		((or) #f)
		((or x) x)
		((or x1 x2 ...)
			(if x1 x2 (or x2 ...))
		)
	)
)
```

- however this will evaluate `x2` multiple times, once for every argument
  - NOT good! esp if u have side effects

####  ‚úÖ  (mostly) RIGHT way

```scheme
(define-syntax or
	(syntax-rules ()
		((or) #f)
		((or x) x)
		((or x1 x2 ...)
			(let ((v x1))
				(if v v (or x2 ...))
			)
		)
	)
)
```

- however, if we try to nest these statements, we run into the *problem of capture* (in macros) which is that `v` will always be overwritten by the most recent evaluation
- scheme does NOT have this problem! because it keeps track of the nesting and the variables to which they apply
  - this is called **hygienic macros**

### Macros üí™ 

In C (unhygienic):

```c
#define min(a,b) (a < b ? a : b)
min(x&y, z+1)
// this will become:
min(x&(y < z+1) : x&y : z+1)
// if u put parentheses around the arguments it will "fix" the problem
```

- no matter how you implement this macro, C can run into the problem of capture

In Scheme:

```scheme
(define-syntax let
	(syntax-rules ()
		((let ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
        	((lambda (name ...) body1 body2 ...) val ...)
        )
        ((let tag ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
        	(letrec ((tag (lambda (name ...) body1 body2 ...))))
         ; the body1 body2 ... can refer to the tag function
         ; i.e. the function can call itself
         	tag
         ; ^ now call the function lol
        )
	)
)
```

- `let` is syntactic sugar for defining and calling a function
- `letrec` is similar to OCaml's `let rec ‚Ä¶`
  - in a recursive `let` you can refer to the identifiers you are creating as you are creating them

## Continuations

"gotos of Scheme"

Controversial! üò± 

- Powerful but maybe too much so
- Some ppl want to get rid of them
- Just like `goto` is "bad practice," continuations are as well

*A low-level building block that can build useful, higher-level stuff*.

### Inside the Interpreter üëæ 

When building a Scheme program, there are two things the interpreter üëæ needs to know:

1. What am I doing/evaluating next?
   1. This sits in the `rip` /instruction pointer register
   2. This will point to an expression, not a bytecode or a machine value!
2. What do I do with the result of an expression?
   1. Think of an analogous "environment pointer" `rep` that will point into the stack frame of the calling function ‚òéÔ∏è 

In Scheme, there is a way to "reach" into the interpreter and access the instruction and environment pointers (`rip` and `rep`)

- This object that is returned is called a **continuation**

### What Is It? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

*A small object representing where the current Scheme program is*

- Represents the instruction and environment pointers 

### How Do I Make One?

There is a builtin function `call-with-current-continuation` (abbreviated `call/cc`) that takes in an expression `E` that will:

1. evaluate `E`
   1. `E` is an expression that returns a function
   2. you couldn't `call/cc` with 27 for example
2. assign the result of `E` to `p`
3. create a continuation `k` that points to the calling function
   1. Inside `k` points to the instruction and environment pointers
4. call `p` with `k` (`(p k)`)
   1. **return** this value

### How Do I Use It? üéà 

1. let `E1` be a value
2. `v` is the result of evaluating `E1`
3. set the interpreter's `rip` and `rep` from the contents of `k`
   1. `k` preserves how the instruction and environment pointers used to look like
   2. and is used to overwrite them and <u>change the flow of the program</u>

analogous to `goto K` and then return `E1`

- this will propogate üíß the value of `E1` from the function inside the `goto` to the calling function

it can return multiple times!

### Examples

#### Regular

```scheme
; walks down a list of numbers and multiplies all of them
; if there is a 0 in the list LN, return 0 immediately
; so immediately that we dont multiple AT ALL if we see a 0
(define (prod LN)
	; we use a callcc to return immediately
  (call/cc (lambda (break)
   				(let pr ((LN LN))
                 	(cond
                     	((null? LN) 1)
                     	((= (car LN) 0) (break 0))
                     	(else 
                         	(* (car LN) (pr (cdr LN)))
                        )
                     )
                 )
            ) ; the continuation break points to the end of this func right here
  )
)
```

Example execution:

1. prod '(3 5 0 2)
2. pr '(3 5 0 2)
   1. (* 3 (pr '(5 0 2)))
      1. (* 5 (pr '(0 2)))
         1. (break 0)
         2. Immediately return back to #1 ^

```c
#include <setjmp.h>
typedef ??? jmp_buf [???];

int setjmp (jmp_buf env) {
    // callcc in C basically
    // returns 0 the first time it has executed
    // fills in the continuation with instruction pointer and environment pointer
}

void longjmp (jmp_buf env, int val) {
    // (k val) in C
    jmp_buf k;
    if (setjmp(k)) {
        // someone has used the continuation
        // ie someone has called longjmp before
        error();
    } else {
        // compute!
    }
}
```

#### Cheap Multi-threading

```scheme
(define thlist '())	
(define (thnew thunk) ; creates a thread and runs thunk on it where thunk is a func
  (set! thlist (append thlist (list thunk)))
)
(define (start)
  (let ((th (car thlist)))
    (set! thlist (cdr thlist))
    (th)
  )
)

(define (yield)
  (call/cc (lambda (k)
             (thnew (lambda () (k 42)))
             (start)
            ))
)
```

- This will work with only one core
  - When you want to transfer control to another thread, use a continuation! 
- Green threads üå≥
