## Storage 📦/ Memory 🧠 Management

There are certain bits of memory that are "forbidden" 🚫

- `char *p = NULL` `p` will point to 0x0 which is forbidden and thus `*p = 'x'` will "crash" 💥 

The hardware 💾  can mark pages in memory as:

1. non-existent
   1. `- - -`
2. read-only
   1. `r - -`
   2. ex: `const`
3. read, execute only
   1. `r - x`
   2. ex: program data
4. read-write
   1. `r w -`
   2. other data that u need to read from and write to
5. read-write-execute
   1. `r w x`
   2. most likely you don't want to use because if you have a bug in your program, you can write into the memory page and then execute what you have written
   3. it can also lead to security vulnerabilities
   4. useful though for self-writing code

### Stuff to Put Into Memory

1. program instructions
2. library instructions
3. static variables (allocated at compile (really startup) time)
4. heap variables (allocated dynamically)
5. stack variables (`auto`)
   1. allocated upon entrance into a function
   2. LIFO - very cheap

### Functions ☎️ 

Sometimes function don't have return instructions!

1. Tail-recusion optimization

```c
int f(int x) {
    ...
    return g(x+3);
}
```

- Here there is no point in returning to `f` because it returns exactly where `g` returns

2. `_Noreturn` functions (i.e. `longjmp`)

```c
_Noreturn
int f(int x) {
    ...
    longjmp(b, 27);
}
```

#### Static Scoping and Nested Functions 🦢 

```c
int f(int x) {
    int g(int y) {
        return (x + y);
    }
}
```

How do we know that - in the above function - the register storing `x` hasn't been 💥 blown away 💥?

**Activation records!** They allow us to store our variables in previous calls.

- Saved in the stack
- We have a **frame pointer** 🖼 👈

We also have to use **fat pointers** 🍔 to represent nested functions

- Not just one word (64-bit)
- TWO words
  - The first word is the regular function pointer that points to machine code for the function
    - <u>Instruction</u> pointer
  - The second word points to the calling function's frame ☎️ 🖼 
    - The calling function is the function that contains the definition for our current function
    - <u>Environment</u> pointer

Wait a minute! ---

Haven't we seen these before???

Yes! These are basically **continuations** in Scheme 

### Arrays

Annoying!

> "The stress test for allocators" - Eggert

They can be really small or really big 🤷‍♂️ 

#### Allocation Methods 

1. **Static** allocation (usually not put in the stack)
   1. 👍 Simple, predictable, fast 
   2. FORTRAN was done in this originally!
   3. 👎 Inflexible (you must know the size)
      1. Many programmers estimated by over-allocating
      2. However sometimes ofc you under-estimate and ur screwed 🔩
   4. 👎 NO RECURSION 😱 
2. **Stack** allocation
   1. 👍 simple-ish, pretty fast, allows recursion ✅, more flexible
   2. 👎 less predictable because it is generally impossible to predict the stack size ahead of time (stack overflow!)
   3. 👎 the lifetime of the array is limited to the function that created t
3. **Dynamic/heap** allocation
   1. 👍 NOT LIFO, much more flexible, very powerful
   2. 👎 storage management is more complex (you cannot simply add to the stack pointer to allocate space and subtract from it to free space)

### Nested Function Frames 🖼 

```scheme
(define f
	(lambda (x)
		(lambda (y)
			(+ x y)
		)
	)
)
```

How does this work in light of what we have learned today?

- The inner `lambda (y)` has an instruction pointer that points to `(+ x y)` and an environment pointer to `lambda (x)`
- When `lambda (y)` executes, **X HAS ALREADY RETURNED**
- It's almost like `lambda (x)` has a frame that exceeds the lifetime of the function itself

In Scheme and OCaml, <u>frames are not always LIFO</u> 

- When a function returns, you cannot necessarily free its frame
- You cannot free a frame until all the functions that it defines - all functions that point at the frame - are freed
- The garbage collector is in charge of freeing frames 🖼 ➡️ 🗑 
- This rule - i.e. do not free a frame until no other function points to it - applies both to functions and continuations
- In Scheme, **frames live in the heap**
  - In practice, this can be optimized away by the compiler if the source code does not have any nested functions or use `call/cc` so that frames live on the stack

### Heap Management

Problems:

1. How do you keep track of **roots** 🌲?
   1. Roots are pointers from elsewhere on the heap
   2. Two approaches:
      1. Manual memory management (i.e. `malloc` and `free`) are left to the programmer
         1. C/++
      2. Garbage collector
         1. Most other languages lol
2. How do we manage free space efficiently?
   1. Free list
      1. We store information about the free list in the free spaces themselves
