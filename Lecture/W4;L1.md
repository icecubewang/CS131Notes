## Back to Binding 📎

 even something as simple as

```
int n = 27;
```

there are many metrics to consider here:

- value of n
- address of n
- type of n
- size of n

also consider **binding time** - when a value is bound and when it is not

helpful here is a *dictionary function* - function that maps binding NAMES (i.e. `n`) to binding VALUES (i.e. `27`)

- who creates this dictionary?
- when is it updated?
- when is it made?

### Binding Time ⏰ 

1. at run time, mutable
   1. most simple, most common
2. at run time, when the name is created and immutable after initialization
   1. you cannot change the value after declaration
   2. at the program start?
   3. at the function start?
   4. at the block entry?
   5. so many possibilities! ✨ 

Take the following example:

```c
int glob;
// Binding set when the program starts

int f(void) {
    int loc;
    // Binding time decided at declaration
    // Every time you run function f you get a new binding/address
    // This binding is set upon function entry
}
```

If you run the above program 5 times, will `glob` have the same value each time?

...

...

...

**Yes**, because the program uses the same virtual memory

Thus, this implies that, in fact, the binding for `glob` is NOT decided at run time but rather at *linking time*

3. Linking time
   1. ⚠️ this can be a security vulnerability! because an attacker can guarantee that the `glob` or whatever variable will always have the same address because the binding is declared when the program is compiled
   2. because of the above vulnerability, of course, now many machines support *position independent executables* (`pie`)
4. Load time
   1. when the program is loaded into RAM 🐑 , we perform bindings 💾 
   2. basically linking time using `pie`

5. compile time
6. API definition time
   1. `INT_MAX`

## Types 💧🔥🍃⚡️ 

A *type* is:

- a particular way to interpret byte sequences
- a set of operations

The two definitions are a bit opposite, really. The first is lower-level, machine-code 🤖, concrete specification, while the second is more abstract, and object-oriented.

Regardless of the definition you use, types are an integral component to most programming languages.

We have two main categories:

### Primitive Types 🧱 

Integral to the language

- int, float, bool, char

### Constructed Types 🏠 

User-defined

- usually created out of primitives at the base level

The line between the two is *language-dependent*, i.e. some languages have default `String` support, some make you use `char []`.

### Ex: Float 🌊 

At the low level, floats are made up of three components, the sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 27 value bits

The interpretation of floats is a bit complex, either being interpreted as tiny numbers, denormalized numbers, pos/neg infinity, pos/neg zero, NaNs...

The point 😉 is that once you decide on an internal representation for your type, you can now perform operations on it.

- NaN + 3 = NaN
- infinity + 3 = infinity
- 1/inf = 0
- inf - inf = NaN

## Uses 🔨 

1. As annotations - you write down the types in your program and they guide the reader/compiler
   1. almost like "documentation"
2. For inference - you can predict what the program will do with reasonable certainty
   1. `a+b` where `a` is `char` and `b` is `double` will return a `double` and you know that through type inference
3. For type checking - you aren't predicting what the program will do, but rather predicting bugs 🐜 



## Type Equivalence

Two forms:

1. Structural equivalence - same internal representation, ANY operation on one will work on the other
2. Name equivalence - same names

You can use both!

### Ex: C

#### Structural example:

```
typedef int a, typedef int b;
```

`a` and `b` are now types

But are they the same?

Let's see!

```c
a x;
b y;
x = y; // This works
b *p = &x; // this also works
```

These two types ARE equivalent because C uses structural equiv. for `typedef`

#### Name equivalence

```
struct s {
    int v;
    struct s *next;
}

struct t {
    int v;
    struct t *next;
}
```

`s` is NOT equivalent to `t` because they have different NAMES

### Subtyping 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦

A subset of another type

```
type alpha = 'a'...'z';
```

This lets any user use type `alpha` which subtypes `char` to include only alphabetical characters

Suppose you have:

```c
typedef char * cp;
typedef char const * ccp; // or const char * (they are the same)
```

Are they subtypes of each other?

In what order? Which is the subset?

You can tell the subtype order from assignment statements:

```c
cp x;
ccp y;

x = y; // This is NOT OKAY
y = x; // This is okay though

// because you could do this:
y = "abc";
x = y;
x[0] = 'z';
// and this violates the entire point of const
```

> If X is a subtype of Y, then the set of operations on X is a superset of the operations on Y

i.e. You can perform **more** operations on the subtype/child

- So, for example, you cannot reassign `char const*`  but you CAN `char *`
- Thus, `char *` is a subtype of `char const *`

### Polymorphism 🐶 🐺 

Occurs because type checking goes too far!! 😤

- Types are helpful... to a point
- They can quickly become annoying

So, to avoid this, while still keeping safety in mind, we can have *polymorphic functions*: functions with multiple signatures, each of which specifying the types of args and the return values

Two types:

1. Templates
   1. become instantiated at compile time and *then* they're type-checked
   2. can be more efficient
2. Generics
   1. the code can be determined at compile time
   2. smaller code
