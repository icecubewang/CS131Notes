## Subtypes

In Java, it is deceptively difficult to print out all the strings in a collection. You have to do:

```java
void printAll(Collection<?> c) {
    for (Object i : c)
    	System.out.println(s);
}
```

This is the power of **generics** (note the `?`).



Let's take a sample function which adds an array of objects to a collection of objects:

```java
void convert(Object []a, Collection<Object> e) {
    for (Object o : a)
    	c.add(o);
}
```

And this code *works* but it's a bit restrictive! String subtypes from Object but we can't pass in a String array?! Bogus! 🛑 🤮 

Instead let's try this:

```java
void convert(Object []a, Collection<?> e) {
    for (Object o : a)
    	c.add(o);
}
```

Except, **too bad THIS DOESN'T COMPILE** because the compiler will not let you assign Objects into a collection of "anything". Ok then, what if we didn't assign Objects explicitlty:

```java
void convert(? []a, Collection<?> e) {
    for (? o : a)
    	c.add(o);
}
```

This will not work either because how are you going to iterate over it without being sure it's an object?

Instead, let's use templating!

```java
void convert(T []a, Collection<T> c) {
    for (T o : a)
    	c.add(o);
}
```

Finally! This ✨ works ✨ because the compiler can type check this and guarantee that the objects in `a` will be assignable to those in `c`.

## Generics 🧬 

Generics bring a bit of complication to the actual implementation of them.

For example, for non-generic languages, you merely need to store the type of the variable along with its value/bits in order to specify how to interpret it.

- i.e. you just have `List` type

But for generics, you have to store the type of the instantiated generic as well

- i.e. you now have `List<String>`

Java, however, does not do this, opting instead for implementing generics through **erasure** ✏️, which is done at compile time, not run time, so it doesn't slow down the actual program.

- Some people criticize these type checking systems for being too complicated
  - For example, I *hate* the OCaml type checking system because it is so complicated and hard to understand
  - Furthermore, as languages are getting more complex and adding new features, type checking gets even *MORE COMPLICATED* 🙃 👎 

## Duck Typing 🦆  

Because of this, many languages (i.e. JavaScript, Python) use **duck-typing** 🦆 

- Commonly used in dynamically typed languages 🐛 🦋 
- "If it waddles like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck!" made into a type checking motivation

Duck-typing is basically saying you shouldn't care what type something is or write code like this:

```
if (x is Duck) {
    ... do duck things
}
```

You should do this instead:

```
Duck.quack()
Duck.waddle()
// if fail, figure it out !
```

### Pros 👍 

- More flexible
  - The more rigid and insistent your code will be, the more fragile it will be (the harder it is to hook things together)
- Easier to understand 
- Faster to write code in
- Takes less time to implement

### Cons 👎 

- Runtime overhead
  - Generally, will be somewhat slower than staticly typed language ⚡️ 
- Reliability
  - You can never really be SURE that your program won't crash or error out

## *What is the world's fastest computer?*

[Summit](top500.org) 🏔 

- 4208 nodes each with:
  - 2 IBM PowerChips
  - 6 NVidia Volta M100s
  - 1.6 TB of graphics RAM
- 2.8 PB of RAM
- Essentially it combines MIMD (multiple instruction multiple data) and SIMD (single instruction multiple data)

The motivating question here is:

*Q: How do you measure the speed on this Thing?*



A: **LINPACK**, which measures how many floating point operations you can get per second and make use of

- 143.5 PFLOPS (peta- floating point operations)



Why did Eggert bring this up? Well, because this kind of computing speed is the future and it will require different optimization techniques than code written for modern computers will. The same thing happened with Java, being written for computers then that functioned very differently than newer ones did.

## Let's Look at Java

- Developed by Sun Microsystems
- They had servers and workstations that could be run with multiple CPUs
- Ran a system called Solaris (similar to Linux) written in C
- These engineers here though, they were looking towards the future 🔮 🚀 
- This future had computers _everywhere_, not just your desktop, but in your pocket, in your toaster, in your bathtub, etc.
- They wanted to build a protoype of having Solaris everywhere to this degree - even on toasters! 🍞 
- However... they found some problems with the standard model that Linux and Solaris ran on:
  1. They were used to being proprietary (ran on their own SPARC CPUs). When the Sun engineers went to people who *actually* made toasters and said "It's super simple! Just put a SPARC CPU in your toaster and it's all done!" But they were too expensive 💰💰💰 . What Eggert was getting at here was the actual problem was **multiple kinds of CPUs**, many obscure and very bad, but cheap
     1. The gag here though is that you now need to compile to literally every CPU type ever
  2. Reliability. C and C++ programs dump core too often! 🗑 
  3. Size. C/C++ generated huge executables, too big for the computers of the day. Regular computers in that day had a network speed of 12kb/s (kiloBIT, not byte). Downloading a 237 kB program was just infeasibly slow.
  4. C/C++ don't multithread easily. They do - and we've had to learn it painstakingly - but most programmers don't know how.
- Basically, they came to the decision to steal an idea from Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, who had invented this nifty little thing called a mouse, ethernet, high-density display (HD), and - most relevantly - a programming environment called **SmallTalk**, an IDE.
  - SmallTalk was based on byte code: translating your program to a machine-independent format and then run those bytecodes on an interpreter.
  - Bytecodes were small!
  - Thus problem #3 above was solved! 🎉 😃 
  - SmallTalk was *designed* for OOP, unlike C++ which was a complicated hack on top of C, a language not built for OOP
  - SmallTalk also had a garbage collector. Solved problem #2
  - The entire concept of machine-independent bytecodes solved problem #1
  - But what about #4: multi-threading? SmallTalk was designed for machines running one CPU.
- There were only two problems with SmallTalk in the eyes of Sun
  - Weird, unfamiliar syntax
  - Written by people who liked duck-typing
    - Sun worried it would lead to unreliable programs
- Let's combine SmallTalk and Solaris! 👨‍🍳 
- So they used the syntax of C alongside static typing, but built in: OOP, garbage collection, and byte codes and designed.... the world-famous....
- Oak
- Wait what
- Yep! Not Java, sorry!
- Anyways the prototypes for Oak worked super well and people loved it!
- However, they did not make money and eventually the lab was shut down and all the engineers had to write up their work and go back to their old jobs 😞 
- In the meantime, something was getting everyone's attention: Mosaic 🖼  The world's first browser!
- Mosaic was written in C++
  - So it crashed a lot
  - And it was a **program**: you had to compile it and could NOT change after the fact
- So, Sun decided to one-up Mosaic and - over the weekend - decided to write a web browser in Java that did not just match but *beat* Mosaic
- They built "HotJava" ♨️ - a browser written in Java over one weekend
- HotJava did everything Mosaic did, did not dump core as much, and had **applets**
  - Now here's something you've heard of!
- Applets were software programs you downloaded from the Internet and could run **in the browser**
- They demoed HotJava and everyone loved it
- Soon, Mosaic invented plug-ins which worked like applets but were programs again, thus requiring a new plugin for every CPU
  - Eventually, Mosaic would inspire: Mozilla (inspired Firefox) and Internet Explorer

Wow, what a story! 📖 👑 🐉 ✨ 

### Versus C++

Java properties that differ from those in C:

- variables are always initialized  
- primitive types are different from reference types
  - they are basically pointers but easier to understand
- the sizes of the types are explicitly set for every type (not different sizes for x86 vs AMD, etc.)
  - this makes Java code more portable - you can run it on any machine running the interpreter, even the strange and elusive 9-bit machine
- primitives are not objects
  - this is a controversial move because you will special cases to deal with primitives vs objects
  - thus Java is not purely OOP
  - this is a win for performance though because you cannot subtype or mess with them, so you can assume they operate precisely how you specified

### Object Types

#### Arrays

Zero-index, indexed by integer

**Must** be initialized on the heap/be dynamic (i.e. `new Array[37]`)

- However you cannot change the length once created

All objects in Java are like this: they live on the heap

Is orthogonal unlike C!

- i.e. you can return an array from a function

#### Classes

Uses single inheritance (when you design a class you can subclass, but from only one parent)

- any object not subclassing explicitly will subclass from a global `Object`
