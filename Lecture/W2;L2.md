## Syntax and Tokenization

It matters!

**Bytes do not equal characters**

We now have **UTF-8 encoding**

### Eggert's Bug üêõ 

Sometimes there can be bugs due to tokenization.

```c
print(x);
// why the @#!? isn't this working??/
x = 27;
print(x);
```

compiled into this:

```assembly
push 19
call print
push 19
call print
```

because `??\` translates to the `\` character due to some complicated and unfortunate Danish history.

Therefore the program was really:

```c
print(x)
print(x)
```

### Tokens Are Not Characters

`+` is NOT the same as `++`, even though they are represented by the same characters. `+` is "PLUS" `++` is "INCREMENT"

What about:

```c
int x = a+++++b;
```

which **should** translate to:

```c
int x = a++ + ++b;
```

The compiler will complain! Why?

Another example!

This will compile:

```c
a = b/ * p;
```

This won't:

```c
a = b/*p;
```

As you can maybe see from the syntax highlighting on this document, these are different even though they only differ by ONE SPACE (the first is division; the second is a comment)





**Tokenizers are greedy.**





They will take as much as they can. Therefore, the first example is actually:

```
int x = a+++++b;
[int][ ][x][ ][=][ ][a][++][++][+][b][;]
```

And you cannot do this `(a++)++` because you cannot assign `a++` to anything. (i.e. you cannot, similarly, do this: `a++ = 1`)

### Integers and Tokens

Why is this invalid:

```c
int x = -2147428348;
```

Where we assume `-2147428348` is exactly `INT_MIN`.

Why is this not valid C code? Because it is **machine-dependent**

`-2147428348` is really **two tokens**: the minus token and the unsigned integer token.

Likewise, this will not print "Ok":

```c
if (-2147428348 < 0) { print("Ok"); }
```

### Reserved Words

You cannot do:

`int if = 12;`

**Reserved words** are a specific subclass of **keywords** that you cannot use as identifiers.

- Because they can break programs, adding them is a Big Deal üíØ üòé 

They are not the same!

`if` is a **reserved word**, thus you cannot do `int if = 12`

`define` is a **keyword**, you can still do `int define = 12`

You can actually have languages without reserved words! But they have to be very carefully designed. PL/I. ("pee ell one") has no reserved words.

### Note

> C++ is NOT a strict superset of C-code, because you cannot do:
>
> `int class = 14` in C++, but you can in C

### Note

> NEVER begin variable declaration in C with an underscore and a capital letter (i.e. `int _Xa = 12`) because `_[CAPITAL]` is a reserved word

## Syntax At Its Lowest Level üìñ 

*Syntax* - The form, independent of meaning, of a (programming) language/notation.

- We do not care about WHAT you are trying to communicate
- We only care that you communicate correctly
- i.e. We don't care what letter is inside the envelope, as long as you have a properly formatted address.

### Famous Example

> *Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.* - Chomsky

The **syntax** is correct (we have a noun phrase, verb, adverb all used correctly), but the **semantics** are garbage (you cannot have "colorless green," "how can ideas sleep", etc.)

### Eggert's Example

> Ireland has leprechauns galore. - Eggert

The **semantics** are perfectly clear (Ireland has many leprechauns) and any native English speaker will understand, but the **syntax** is confusing (is galore an adverb or an adjective)

- "Galore" is actually an **adjective**
- When the English invaded Ireland, we stole some syntax from Gaelic, where the adjective follows the noun, and even though we understand the meaning of the sentence because "galore" has a certain conventional use, you couldn't say "Ireland has leprechauns green"

### Ambiguity ‚ùì‚ùî

Basically what the above examples highlight is the notion of **ambiguity**, a mismatch between syntax and semantics, or a split in consensus on semantics.

Unlike in languages, **programming notations avoid ambiguity** because it can cause differential and unpredictable behavior.

## Syntax Metrics üéñ 

Reasons to prefer one syntax over another:

1. Familiarity/Inertia - People know the syntax already
   1. i.e. assignment is always done `i = j + 1` because of history
2. Unambiguity
3. Concision
   1. Easy to read
   2. Easy to write
   3. Easy to understand/clear
4. Simplicity
   1. You want a simple syntax with as few rules as possible. Easier to document
5. Convenience
   1. Remember that simplicity and convenience are often **at ends**
   2. ex: PostScript has no parentheses: very simple, but not convenient
      1. 2 3 + 4 *
      2. (2 + 3) * 4

## Parser üå≥ ‚û°Ô∏è üìñ 

The parser **builds a parse tree using a formally defined syntax**.

- A lot of the techniques that people were using to understand natural languages at the time got used in computer science
- Fun fact: using the techniques of the "softer" linguistics field gave computer science more legitimacy and started many departments at universities around the country

### Symbols

Together, two symbols make up any parse tree:

1. **Terminal symbols** - tokens
2. **Non-terminal symbols** - interior nodes in a parse tree
   1. Not actually in the program! 
   2. The compiler builds them

### Grammar

A grammar is a **set/list of possible interior nodes in a parse tree**

- A tool kit for parsing

Given a grammar, you can build all possible parse trees for a given language

The usual notation for defining grammars is:

```
<program> ::= <defns>
<stmt> ::= <return stmt>
<return stmt> ::= RET <exp>
```

A grammar rule always looks like this:

```
<NONTERMINAL SYMBOL> ::= SYMBOL LIST
```

Where the symbol list will be the immediate children of the nonterminal symbol in the parse tree.

Again:

*String* - Finite sequence of tokens

*Language* - Set of strings

*Grammar* - Finite set of production rules, starting with a *start symbol*

- *Start symbol* - a non-terminal symbol that corresponds to the grammar for a language

*Rule* - Nonterminal symbol and finite sequence of child symbols

*Sentence* - A string that is a member of a language



```
Grammar => Parser
```

You can actually automatically generate a parser **from** a grammar

### Note

> Think of a grammar like a **program**, written rather strangely, that instructs you how to write another program.

You should immediately think of "what can go *wrong* with this grammar?"

- ex: Infinite loop

```
<S> ::= [S]
```

### Rules

#### Useless Rules

1. A rule that makes no progress
2. Unreachable from start symbol

```
<S> ::= Sa
<S> ::= b
<T> ::= Ta
```

3. Unresolvable rule
   1. Never resolves to a terminal symbol; there is always another non-terminal symbol
   2. This is not merely when you **can** infinitely loop, this is when you **must**

This is fine:

```
<S> ::= Sa
<S> ::= b
```

This is **not**

```
<S> ::= U
<U> ::= Ua
<U> ::= Ub
```

Because you can **never** resolve `U` even if you wanted to. On the other hand, you **can** resolve `S` eventually with a single `b`.

4. Duplicate rules

```
<S> ::= Sa
<S> ::= Sa
```

5. Overly ambitious
   1. Tries to capture too many details about the language

English example:

```
<S> => NP VP .
<NP> => N
<NP> => Adj NP
<VP> => V
<VP> => VP Adv
```

where `N, V, Adj, Adv` are **tokens**

```
Blue 	dogs 	sleep 	quietly	.
Adj		N		V		Adv		.
	NP				VP			.
			S
```

This is fine.

```
Scout 		sleep 		quietly		.
N			V			Adv			.
NP				VP					.
		S
```

This is **not** because it generates a syntactically invalid sentence (i.e. it SHOULD be "Scout sleep**s** quietly").

So, we notice this and try and fix it with our grammar.

```
S => SNP SVP (singular noun phrase) (singular verb phrase)
S => PNP PVP (plural noun phrase) (plural verb phrase)
PNP => PN
PNP => ADJ PNP
SNP => SN
SNP => ADJ SNP
SVP => SV
SVP => SVP ADV
PVP => PV
PVP => PVP PV
```

This is a more **accurate** grammar, which will catch the above incorrect sentence, BUT it came at a steep price üò±: it roughly *doubled* the complexity of our grammar. Not good!

Imagine the complications if we added three genders (masc., fem., neut.)!

For this reason (i.e. the fact that every new feature you add will double the size of the grammar), this approach to fixing grammars is frowned upon.

Thus, we consider this a **semantic issue**, and not one that should be fixed in the grammar, which should be syntactic.

6. Ambiguous Rules
   1. ex: `return (x+1);` in C is overly complicated due to the parentheses. However, in other languages they might be required.
   2. ex: `while (x < y) x++;` Can we remove the parentheses from THIS example though?
   3.
