## Object Oriented Misconceptions ☝️ 

1. **Object oriented LANGUAGE !== object oriented STYLE 👠**
   1. you can ignore object oriented features of an OOL
   2. you can also write objects in non-OOLs (i.e. C)

2. Static vs dynamic typing
   1. 👍 static: reliability
      1. traditionally, static typing also offered efficiency benefits ⚡️; however nowadays dynamic typing is catching up with JIT compilation ♨️
      2. i.e. JAVASCRIPT RULES 😎 
   2. 👍 dynamic: flexibility

3. Class-based vs prototype-based OOP
   1. class: objects are in classes; classes themselves are NOT instantiated
      1. `O = new C();`
      2. `O.clone()`
      3. **two** ✌️ ways to create an object
      4. i.e. Java, C++
   2. prototype: objects are objects
      1. analogous to only have `clone()` 
      2. **one** ☝️ way to create an object
      3. i.e. JavaScript
4. Subtyping vs Subclassing
   1. "C is a subtype of D IF AND ONLY IF C is a subclass of D in Java ☕️"
   2. True?
   3. ...
   4. ...
   5. ...
   6. **Nope! False**
      1. If C implements a prototype, then C **is** a subclass but is NOT a subtype

## Parameter Passing

You have a *caller* and a *callee*

- caller: `f(x+3, z)`
  - technically these are arguments
- callee: `function f (a, b) { CODE }`
  - and these are parameters

### Goals 🎯 

1. Be as efficient as possible
2. Be as ✨ clear ✨ as possible

### Methods

#### Call by value 🖨 

The caller evaluates the arguments and gets the values

The parameters are arbitrary values and it is the **caller**'s responsibility to evaluate those expressions

The callee merely gets a COPY 🖨 

**👍 PROS**

Simple, easy to explain

**👎 CONS** 

Not as efficient (imagine if the parameters were large arrays)

**Used by**

- C, OCaml, Java

#### Call by reference 🏡 

The caller does not make a copy of the expressions, but passes the ADDRESS 🏡 of the arguments

Caller evaluates the arguments for their addresses

The callee gets the ADDRESSES 🏡

Whenever the callee needs the actual value of the parameters, it dereferences the pointers passed in

**👍 PROS**

Efficiency if you have large parameters

Good to have functions that modify their arguments

**👎 CONS**

Bad performance because if you simply have integers, those are simple - they sit in registers, easy peasy ✨ 

- But dereferencing into memory 🧠 is super slow! 😱 

Aliasing makes code confusing and harder to read (for both humans and compilers! 🤖)

**Used by**

- C++, PL1

#### Call by result

The reverse of call by value

- In CBV, the **caller** evaluates the argument and **passes the result to the callee**
- In CBR, the caller specifies where to put the result and the **callee passes the result to the caller**

Similar to Prolog in that in Prolog you can pass in a variable and during unification either the caller or the callee can "fill in" ✏️  the parameter

- In CBR, ONLY the callee can fill in the parameter

**👍 PROS**

Good for IO calls like `read(fd, buffer, bufsize)`

**Used by**

- Ada

#### Call by value result

Both CBV and CBR

The caller evaluates the argument and passes the copy to the callee, the callee receives the value and can modify the passed in value **upon return**

- Similar to call by reference (CBF) but you don't have the same aliasing issues since you only modify the value upon return and during the execution of the function body, the parameter cannot be modified

**Used by**

- Fortran, Ada (sometimes)

#### Call by unification

**Used by**

- Prolog

#### Call by name

Take the argument and **DON'T** ⛔️  evaluate it! Just "remember" what the argument is and when the callee needs the value, THEN evaluate it

- Implemented with thunks under the covers 🛌 

**👎 CONS**

If you need to value more than once, you will have to call the thunk more than once

#### Call by need/lazy evaluation

Call by name except when you call the thunk, you "remember" the value in the cache

Thus the thunk will be evaluated AT MOST once ☝️ maybe not all 🤷‍♂️ 

**Used by**

- Haskell

## Errors 🙃 

1. Undefined behavior 🤷‍♂️ 

   1. 👍 more efficient code
   2. 👎 unreliable
   3. C

2. System must catch and report errors to the OS and then terminate

   1. 👍 easier to understand and debug, reliable
   2. 👎 slower because the compiler must do run-time checks to detect errors gracefully
   3. Java ☕️ 

3. Total definition

   1. You take everything in your program that can create an error and make some defined pathway for it
   2. ex: IEEE floating point - if you divide by 0.0, then it is NOT undefined but merely leads to infinity
   3. ✨ special ✨ values that *denote* an error but do not cause a crash

4. Compile time checking

   1. ex: OCaml
   2. 👍 reliable (guarantees no errors during runtime)
   3. 👎 inflexible (the computer won't compile even though you know - as a human - that no errors will happen)

5. Pre-conditions

   1. whenever you are worried about the possibility of an error, you write down the conditions/circumstances that could lead to an error
   2. ex: 

   ```
   int divide(int a, int b) preconditon (b != 0 && !(a == INT_MIN && b == -1))
   ```

   1. caller's responsibility to not ensure errors

6. ⚠️ Exception handling
   1. ex: Python, C/++, Java/Script
   2. Define more intelligent and capable error handlers
   3. 👍 more reliable, finer grained, easier to read (theoretically lol 🤮)
