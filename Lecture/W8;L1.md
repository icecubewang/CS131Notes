## Syntax of Scheme 🔮 

- identifiers are any alphanumeric characters and the special symbols: `+ . ? * / < = > : $ % ^ # _ ~ @`
  - IDs cannot start with numerals or symbols
- `;` is a comment
- `#t` is true
- `#f` is false
  - LISP had the rule that the empty list nil `()` was the only thing that was false
  - Scheme changed that and said nope 👎 the only false value is `#f`
  - so `if 0 1 2` will actually be ONE! not 2! because 0 is NOT `#f`
- functions declared with `lambda` keyword 🐑 
- lists

```scheme
;ALL EQUIVALENT
(a b c . d)
(a . (b c . d))
(a . (b .( c. d)))
```

- vectors
  - declared with `#`
  - more efficient than lists if fixed length data, but less flexible
- apostrophe `'` ☁️ 
  - in Scheme **the same syntax is used for data and programs**
  - the apostrophe can be used to say "treat the following code Not as code/a program but as data (i.e. the bytes themselves)"
  - `'(a b c)` is `'(a b c)` literally; the code is not executed to actually create the list
  - syntactic sugar 🍯 for the `quote()` function
  - when you see a quote, everything inside that quote is data, full stop no exception
- quasiquote "`" 🌫 
  - works like quote but u can switch back to using code/program rather than just data
  - a `,` comma is used to mean "switch back to code! stop quoting!"
  - when you see a QUASIquote, you go through the expression inside the quasiquote and evaluate any sub-expression that is un-quoted/with comma `,`

```
`,(f 1) === (f 1)
; because quasiquote ` and dequote , are inverse
```

## Programs in Scheme

### Function Calls ☎️ 

Represented by `n`-argument lists, where `n` must be at least 1

- Argument `n=1` is the function name itself
- Every function call looks like a list but a list is not necessarily a function call (these exceptions are called ✨ *special forms* ✨ 
  - `if` is a special form because it is a keyword (NOT a reserved word) where the following token is not a function argument but a conditional
    - you CANNOT implement `if` as a function because functions evaluate all the arguments (Scheme is call by value) and then pass those arguments to the function
    - the very REASON for `if` is because you do NOT ☝️ want to evaluate some bit of code
  - `not` (like `(not E)`) is NOT 😉 a special form because you can implement it with a function call
  - exceptions to Scheme's ideally purely-functional implementation

**Parentheses matter in Scheme**

- Every new set of parentheses creates a new function call

#### Lambda 🐑 

Basic syntax: `(lambda () E1 … EN)`

- `lambda (a1…am) E1 … EN)` will evaluate all the arguments `a1...an` left-to-right, discard all expressions `E1...E(N-1)`, and assign the answer to the last expression `EN`
- Also accepts **trailing arguments** signified with a PERIOD `.` and packages them as a list
  - if you want a function that takes 0 or more args you use `lambda a E1…EN` where `a` will be any arguments passed, or the empty list
